# Application of Linear Algebra in Genetics

  Our aim is to show  how linear algebra can be used to predict the genotype distribution of a particular characteristic  in a population after any number of generations from only the genotype distribution of the  initial population. There are several modes of inheritance; however, this project will focus only  on autosomal inheritance. 

  We have created a program in Python (Without using any Library) that allows users to know the  genotype distribution of a particular characteristic of a specific animal, human or any living  organism. This will help users to get the perfect pair of parents which will give desired  offspring they wanted. In order to perform such an analysis, we will use several advanced  concepts from linear algebra, such as: Difference equations, diagonalization of a matrix,  inverse of a matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
